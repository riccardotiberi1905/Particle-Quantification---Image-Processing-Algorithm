# Particle-Quantification---Image-Processing-Algorithm

The main file corresponds to the MATLAB script titled: main.m.

This code depends on an 8mm circle that is present in every image for length reference. You might change it with another shape and size, but then the "table_characteristics.m" script must be changed accordingly.

A jpg image is available in the repository for interested users.
