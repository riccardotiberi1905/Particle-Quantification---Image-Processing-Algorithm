# Particle-Quantification---Image-Processing-Algorithm

The main file corresponds to the MATLAB script titled: defcropping.m
"I" corresponds to the image you want to analyze.
"rect" is the specific zone in the image you want to analyze.
This code depends on an 8mm circle that is present in every image for length reference. You might change it with another shape and size, but then the "tablecharacteristics.m" script must be changed accordingly.
